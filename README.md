# MERN Authentication

# Description

This repository offers a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) authentication template that can be used to develop secure web applications with user authentication. It consists of a frontend built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly interface. The backend server is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for data storage. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.js, and authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for added security. The template also includes features like user registration, login, protected routes to control access for authenticated users, and integration with MongoDB to store user data.
